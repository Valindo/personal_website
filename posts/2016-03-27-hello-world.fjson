{"body": "<div class=\"section\" id=\"hello-world\">\n<h1>Hello World<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#hello-world\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">\u00b6</a></h1>\n<p><strong>Hello World!</strong> The title of this post in the honour of the first program that is written\nwhile learning programming. This is my first post on the blog, and hence I&#8217;m calling it\n<strong>Hello World!</strong> post. I&#8217;m mainly passionate about technology and coding is my passion.\nI&#8217;m right now a student studying M.Tech at Manipal Institute of Technology, Manipal. The\nmain reason of writing this blog is to share with the world what I think, and the new things\nthat I learn. I also like learning about some cool science-related concepts esp. w.r.t.\nPhysics. I&#8217;m also a noob Guitarist and a hobby swimmer. Other things that I like are eating\nand trying out different cuisines.</p>\n<p>This blog will be dedicated to writing a lot of things, mainly about different things I learn\nwhile coding and some tips and techniques you won&#8217;t easily find on the internet. I will also\nwrite about various experiences that I have while being here at Manipal, and also when I go\nto discover different and new places. There will be many articles that will be more like\nchain articles, which will be written in tutorial form which will tell how things are to be\ndone (usually related to computer science). Another main reason behind writing this blog is\nto satisfy my thirst for writing. I&#8217;m not really great at writing, but I love to write a lot.\nAnd who says that you need really good grammar and vocabulary to write? I&#8217;ll just write and\nput my own content here.</p>\n<p>I won&#8217;t go ahead boring you with my talk and go in for my next post about something that will\nbe more interesting to read.</p>\n</div>\n", "alabaster_version": "0.7.8", "display_toc": false, "title": "Hello World", "sourcename": "2016-03-27-hello-world.rst.txt", "customsidebar": null, "metatags": "", "current_page_name": "2016-03-27-hello-world", "next": {"link": "../2016-07-14-finally-an-android-app/", "title": "Finally an Android app"}, "rellinks": [["genindex", "General Index", "I", "index"], ["2016-07-14-finally-an-android-app", "Finally an Android app", "N", "next"], ["index", "Welcome to Tanay&#8217;s Blog&#8217;s documentation!", "P", "previous"]], "meta": {}, "parents": [], "sidebars": null, "toc": "<ul>\n<li><a class=\"reference internal\" href=\"#\">Hello World</a></li>\n</ul>\n", "prev": {"link": "../", "title": "Welcome to Tanay&#8217;s Blog&#8217;s documentation!"}, "page_source_suffix": ".rst"}
