I\nhad used Android Studio before but never tired serious android development after the very\nfirst time I tried it in Eclipse (the old times when there was not android studio).</p>\n<p>I chose a very old idea that I had before for voting. I thought I will make an app that\naccepts votes from people. This had to be something different from the regular apps. The main\ndifference being that people should not have to install an app and/or should not have to open\nto a website to cast a vote. Hence, people should use the platform they are already using.\nTherefore I chose to go in for some messaging platform. The most popular platform out there\nis Whatsapp but again the problem with Whatsapp is that they don\u2019t have any open APIs and\nmoreover it\u2019s illegal to reverse engineer the Whatsapp APIs. The other option is Telegram who\nhave their APIs completely open. But the problem with doing it with Telegram is that they\nhave very few users compared to Whatsapp. I had to settle somewhere in between the two\nchoices. That\u2019s the reason I chose traditional SMS over Telegram or Whatsapp.</p>\n<p>Concept and design choices</p>\n<p>Now it was time to design the app for voting but directly jumping for voting was a bit too\nmuch for processing and adding too much to the design and in addition to that some extra time\nin the development of the project. I thought of making it very simple and just storing the\nSMSes. So I finalised with the idea of writing an app that will accept registrations through\nthe means of SMSes. Hence the name SMServer, a Short Message Server, the server with which\npeople can accept SMSes from the user and store them.</p>\n<p>How the app works\u02d0</p>\n<p>The basic idea is to accept the SMSes in a particular format . Suppose you are accepting the\napplications for a party that you are hosting it will be as follows. For example, let\u2019s say\nI\u2019m hosting an event and I want to accept the people\u2019s names via SMS. So I will create a new\nform for accepting the people who are willing to join the event. Suppose the event is some\nmusic show, I will accept the applications in the following format.</p>\n<p>&lt;code&gt;MUSIC&amp;lt;space&amp;gt;NAME&amp;lt;space&amp;gt;AGE&lt;/code&gt;</p>\n<p>Suppose John Doe is registering for an event, his message will be as follows:</p>\n<p>&lt;code&gt;MUSIC John 27&lt;/code&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;p&gt;\nAll the words that I\u2019m accepting via the app are case insensitive. The reason being that\nthere should be no mismatch between the words being just because of the case. At least the\nfirst word has to be kept case insensitive.\n&lt;/p&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;h2&gt;A screen to screen working for the app&lt;/h2&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;h3&gt;This is my emulator running Nexus 5&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;img className=&#8217;center&#8217; alt=&#8221;emulator&#8221; src=&#8221;/images/smserver_images/01_emulator.png&#8221; /&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;h3&gt;This is the starting screen when you first start the app&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;img className=&#8217;center&#8217; alt=&#8221;start_screen&#8221; src=&#8221;/images/smserver_images/02_start_screen.png&#8221; /&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;h3&gt;Now you click on the right-top corner menu button for creating a new form&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;img className=&#8217;center&#8217; alt=&#8221;main_menu&#8221; src=&#8221;/images/smserver_images/03_main_menu.png&#8221; /&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;h3&gt;These are the details that you have to fill up to accept registrations&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;img className=&#8217;center&#8217; alt=&#8221;new_form&#8221; src=&#8221;/images/smserver_images/04_new_form.png&#8221; /&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;h3&gt;Also included, date and time selectors&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;img className=&#8217;center&#8217; alt=&#8221;calender_selector&#8221; src=&#8221;/images/smserver_images/05_calender_selector.png&#8221; /&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;h3&gt;Fill up this form&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;img className=&#8217;center&#8217; alt=&#8221;filled_form&#8221; src=&#8221;/images/smserver_images/07_filled_form.png&#8221; /&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\nThe name for the new form is the name that you want to give to the form which will accept\nregistrations, the form name will be for your own reference\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\nThe starting date and time are the date and time when the form should start accepting the\nentries\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\nSame goes for the ending time and date\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\nThe first word is the first word that you have to enter to enter to accept the entry as an\nentry for this particular form\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\nThe fields are the remaining words from the SMS that you will be accepting as fields in\nthe form\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;\nThe form will be saved when you click the save button\n&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;h3&gt;On the main screen you will see the newly created form&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;img className=&#8217;center&#8217; alt=&#8221;main_screen_form_created&#8221; src=&#8221;/images/smserver_images/10_main_screen_form_created.png&#8221; /&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;h3&gt;You can either open the form&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;img className=&#8217;center&#8217; alt=&#8221;form_menu&#8221; src=&#8221;/images/smserver_images/08_form_menu.png&#8221; /&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;h3&gt;After opening the form you can see the details of the form&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;img className=&#8217;center&#8217; alt=&#8221;opened_form_no_entries&#8221; src=&#8221;/images/smserver_images/09_opened_form_no_entries.png&#8221; /&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;h4&gt;\nIt will also list the phone numbers and date and time of the people who have just registered\n&lt;/h4&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;h3&gt;Now send an SMS to yourself with that format, I\u2019ll send the same SMS (music john 28)&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;img className=&#8217;center&#8217; alt=&#8221;main_screen_form_created&#8221; src=&#8221;/images/smserver_images/10_main_screen_form_created.png&#8221; /&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;h3&gt;\nThen you can go to the main screen and come back by opening the form and you will see the\nentry for the newly received SMS\n&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;img className=&#8217;center&#8217; alt=&#8221;entry_made&#8221; src=&#8221;/images/smserver_images/11_entry_made.png&#8221; /&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;h3&gt;\nYou can then click the form and say \u201cSave the records\u201d this will allow you to share the CSV\nfile, keep in mind that you have to select an app that allows sending of CSV files, I\u2019ll\nrecommend to use an email app and you can also delete the form\n&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;img className=&#8217;center&#8217; alt=&#8221;form_menu&#8221; src=&#8221;/images/smserver_images/08_form_menu.png&#8221; /&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;h3&gt;You can see the server running in the background in the notification drawer&lt;/h3&gt;\n&lt;img className=&#8217;center&#8217; alt=&#8221;server_running_in_background&#8221; src=&#8221;/images/smserver_images/12_server_running_in_background.png&#8221; /&gt;</p>\n<p>&lt;h4&gt;\nNow that you have seen how the app works, you can download the app by clicking\n&lt;a href=&#8221;<a class=\"reference external\" href=\"https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8ZGvtCVIoJgNlZPMnU3WHVXcFk\">https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B8ZGvtCVIoJgNlZPMnU3WHVXcFk</a>&#8220;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.\nAlso, do test it on your own and report any bugs to me.
