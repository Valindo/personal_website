I\nhad used Android Studio before but never tired serious android development after the very\nfirst time I tried it in Eclipse (the old times when there was not android studio).</p>\n<p>I chose a very old idea that I had before for voting. I thought I will make an app that\naccepts votes from people. This had to be something different from the regular apps. The main\ndifference being that people should not have to install an app and/or should not have to open\nto a website to cast a vote. Hence, people should use the platform they are already using.\nTherefore I chose to go in for some messaging platform. The most popular platform out there\nis Whatsapp but again the problem with Whatsapp is that they don\u2019t have any open APIs and\nmoreover it\u2019s illegal to reverse engineer the Whatsapp APIs. The other option is Telegram who\nhave their APIs completely open. But the problem with doing it with Telegram is that they\nhave very few users compared to Whatsapp. I had to settle somewhere in between the two\nchoices. That\u2019s the reason I chose traditional SMS over Telegram or Whatsapp.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"concept-and-design-choices\">\n<h2>Concept and design choices<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#concept-and-design-choices\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">\u00b6</a></h2>\n<p>Now it was time to design the app for voting but directly jumping for voting was a bit too\nmuch for processing and adding too much to the design and in addition to that some extra time\nin the development of the project. I thought of making it very simple and just storing the\nSMSes. So I finalised with the idea of writing an app that will accept registrations through\nthe means of SMSes. Hence the name SMServer, a Short Message Server, the server with which\npeople can accept SMSes from the user and store them.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"how-the-app-works\">\n<h2>How the app works<a class=\"headerlink\" href=\"#how-the-app-works\" title=\"Permalink to this headline\">\u00b6</a></h2>\n<p>The basic idea is to accept the SMSes in a particular format . Suppose you are accepting the\napplications for a party that you are hosting it will be as follows. For example, let\u2019s say\nI\u2019m hosting an event and I want to accept the people\u2019s names via SMS. So I will create a new\nform for accepting the people who are willing to join the event. Suppose the event is some\nmusic show, I will accept the applications in the following format.</p>\n<div class=\"code highlight-default\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><span class=\"n\">MUSIC</span><span class=\"o\">&lt;</span><span class=\"n\">space</span><span class=\"o\">&gt;</span><span class=\"n\">NAME</span><span class=\"o\">&lt;</span><span class=\"n\">space</span><span class=\"o\">&gt;</span><span class=\"n\">AGE</span>\n</pre></div>\n</div>\n<p>Suppose John Doe is registering for an event, his message will be as follows:</p>\n<div class=\"code highlight-default\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre><span></span><span class=\"n\">MUSIC</span> <span class=\"n\">John</span> <span class=\"mi\">27</span>\n</pre></div>\n</div>\n<p>All the words that I\u2019m accepting via the app are case insensitive. The reason being that\nthere should be no mismatch between the words being just because of the case. At least the\nfirst word has to be kept case insensitive.</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"section\" id=\"a-screen-to-screen-working-for-the-app\">\n<h2>A screen to screen working for the app<a
