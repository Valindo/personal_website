    <p><b>Hello World!</b> The title of this post in the honour of the first program that is written while learning
        programming. This is my first post on the blog, and hence I'm calling it **Hello World!** post. I'm mainly
        passionate about technology and coding is my passion. I'm right now a student studying M.Tech at Manipal
        Institute of Technology, Manipal. The main reason of writing this blog is to share with the world what I think,
        and the new things that I learn. I also like learning about some cool science-related concepts esp. w.r.t.
        Physics. I'm also a noob Guitarist and a hobby swimmer. Other things that I like are eating and trying out
        different cuisines.</p>

    <p>This blog will be dedicated to writing a lot of things, mainly about different things I learn while coding and some
        tips and techniques you won't easily find on the internet. I will also write about various experiences that I have
        while being here at Manipal, and also when I go to discover different and new places. There will be many articles
        that will be more like chain articles, which will be written in tutorial form which will tell how things are to be
        done (usually related to computer science). Another main reason behind writing this blog is to satisfy my thirst
        for writing. I'm not really great at writing, but I love to write a lot. And who says that you need really good
        grammar and vocabulary to write? I'll just write and put my own content here.</p>

    <p>I won't go ahead boring you with my talk and go in for my next post about something that will be more interesting
        to read.</p>
