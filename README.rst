Static Website Generator
========================

This repository contains a very small yet powerful static website generator which is used to make static website by
using reusable components that will be used across the website and uses ``make`` as a tool to have incremental builds of
the website. The attempt is to keep things very clean and do it the "Unix way" by representing everything in files. This
repository is currently used to build my personal website and is open for other to use to build their website as it is
MIT license. This website uses JINJA2 as a templating engine for generating the intermediate components and websites.
Please submit a pull request if you want to fix any issue or submit any feature you feel to be missing.
